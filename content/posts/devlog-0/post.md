@title The start of an idea (devlog #0)
@date 2021-01-20

This is the first installment of a series of devlogs I hope to keep writing
throughout the process of writing my cricket management game Ultra Cricket. The idea is for it to help me elucidate my own thoughts on the direction and decisions I take throughout this journey, and hopefully keep me motivated and on the right track with things.

I had come up with a rough idea to make an attempt at creating a cricket game based on conversations with my brother, an avid cricket and cricket gaming fan. The de-facto cricket game was, and still is, Cricket Captain. There have been rumblings in the community that the game is growing too stale, outdated and with development and new features almost being treated as an afterthought. Systems within the game are vague and shallow and the overall user experience for players is (in our opinion) not fully realised. However the simple fact is that there is no alternative, and with steam reviews growing worse over the past few years, we saw a gap in the market.

Obviously this is not without its concerns. Taking on a game project is notoriously sketchy. The vast majority of indie game projects, or at least those with a view to be financially viable, end up failing. And here's me - with no gamedev experience whatsoever attempting to create something I barely have any idea about. The other aspect being that Cricket Captain - the inspiration for this game - has faltering views from it's own players. Does that signify that interest is diminishing in these kinds of games? Well given that the problems they raise with Cricket Captain as a game are so specific, we decided to give it a shot anyway.

We want to keep our ears to the ground with regards to existing players concerns and try and address those while making the best product we can. Plus, just take a look at Football Manager, a game with a large and thriving community (as far as I can tell). Plus I'm confident in our resident cricket guru, Isaac, to really nail down those finer details all the players are desperate for!

The other game that I'm aware of that's also in potential contention is Cricket Coach. They look to be working on a similar idea to ours but have the benefit of a good deal of years development on their engine, along with an actual released game (Cricket Coach 14). Based on their twitter they've had a sequel in development for about 6 years at this point so that will be a space to keep an eye on.

We're working on a pretty unconventional stack, especially for gamedev. I believe that this has the potential to be at least one of our competitive edges in this space. Well, that and the ludicrous amount of knowledge that our team has with regards to cricket. Hopefully I can capitalise on that and make the best of it with the skills that I have too.

Here's a very early sneak peek of a proof of concept that we have so far.
